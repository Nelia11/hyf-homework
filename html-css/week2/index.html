                <p>
                    Examples of dramatic transformations in communication
                    and commerce led by web development include e - commmerce. 
                    Online auction sites such as eBay have changed 
                    the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. 
                    Online reailers such as Amason.com and Buy.com 
                    (among many others) have transformed the shopping 
                    and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.

                <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing 
                    industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use 
                    their website to sell products and services to customers. [1]
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is open source software for wed develooment like BerkeleyDB. GlassFish,
                    LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of 
                    leaming web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the 
                    growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development 
                    software, such as Adobe Dreamweauer, BlueGrition and Microsoft Visual 
                    Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming 
                    languages is still required to use such software but the basics can be learned and 
                    implemented quickly with the help of hep files technical books, internet tutorials, 
                    or face-to-face training.
                </p>    
                <p>    
                    An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more 
                    dynamic and interactive websites. Further web developers now help to deliver 
                    applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications
                     on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many oppartunities to de
                    centralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise 
                    of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These 
                    web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, 
                    instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.
