TIRAMISU

First, you need to divide the egg yolks and egg whites in two separate bowls and add 3 tbsps of sugar to each. Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff and glossy.
Then continue with the egg yolks and whisk those with an electric whisk until pale and thick.
Next, add the mascarpone and whisk again until smooth and creamy.
Next, add one-third of the whisked egg whites to the mascarpone mixture and gently fold it in as you would with a cake batter. Continue with the remaining whites a third at a time until it's completely incorporated.
Mix the espresso and coffee liqueur in a shallow bowl and dip in the Savoiardi ladyfingers for 1-2 seconds on each side and line them on the bottom of the dish in an even layer.
Next, add half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers and spread out in an even layer, top with some grated dark chocolate.
Repeat with a second layer of soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone as directed above. Finally, dust with cocoa powder and chill in the fridge for roughly 6-8 hours.
